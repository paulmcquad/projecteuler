# A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.
# 
# Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:
# 
# A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly below the current position.
# 
# Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are up to three numbers above it).
# 
# The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion (x + y + z)n.
# 
# How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y + z)200000 are multiples of 1012?

#We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal's triangle are divisible by 7:
  	  	  	  	  	  	 #1
  	  	  	  	  	 #1 	  	 1
  	  	  	  	 #1 	  	 2 	  	 1
  	  	  	 #1 	  	 3 	  	 3 	  	 1
  	  	 #1 	  	 4 	  	 6 	  	 4 	  	 1
  	 #1 	  	 5 	  	10 	  	10 	  	 5 	  	 1
#1 	  	 6 	  	15 	  	20 	  	15 	  	 6 	  	 1

#However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only 2361 of the 5050 entries are not divisible by 7.

#Find the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first one billion (109) rows of Pascal's triangle.

#Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (pn−1)n + (pn+1)n is divided by pn2.

#For example, when n = 3, p3 = 5, and 43 + 63 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

#The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 109 is 7037.

#Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 1010.

#Answer:
	#21035

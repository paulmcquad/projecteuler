#KeyZero Conversation approach

#1/x + 1/y = 1/n
#using algebra, we solve for y in terms of x and n
# y = nx/(x-n)
# let d = (x-n)
# y = nx/d
# x = d+n
# y = n(d+n) / d
# y = (nd + n^2)/d
# y = n + n^2/d
# so for y to be integer, we need to find divisors d of n^2
# then backsubstitute
# x, y (with the constraints that n < x <= 2n)

# number of solutions for n is (divisors(n^2)+1)/2

# number of divisors of an integer are product of powers of prime factor + 1.
# i.e. 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. The powers are 3 and 1.  The product of (3+1) and (1+1)
# is 8, so there are eight divisors.

# reduce the search space.  We want to find any value n where n^2 has at least
# 2000 divisors.

# assume that it is made up of squares of small prime numbers
# 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 *7^2 *11^2 * 13^2  (this is six different factors all raised to the
# power of 2).  Also, this is (2*3*5*7*11*13)^2, or 30030^2.
# So number of divisors is (2+1)^6, or 729.  This is too low, but we can start here

# If we go to 7 different factors, we get to
# (2*3*5*7*11*13*17)^2, or 510510^2.
# Number of divisors is (2+1)^7, or 2187.  This is greater than 2000, so this could be it.

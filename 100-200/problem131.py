#There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.

#For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123.

#What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

#How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

#Answer:
	#173

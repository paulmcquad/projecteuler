# Consider the number 45656.
# It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a difference of one.
# A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.
# A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.
# How many pandigital step numbers less than 1040 are there?

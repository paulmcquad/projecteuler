# A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 \leq d\leq 9.

# It can be seen that in the grid

# 6 3 3 0
# 5 0 4 3
# 0 7 1 4
# 1 2 4 5

# the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12.

# In how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 \leq d \leq 9 so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
